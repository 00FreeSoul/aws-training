# AWS for Developers

Welcome to *AWS for Developers* workshop!

This is a one-day workshop that teaches the basics of [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) via the Java SDK. We will develop a Java web application that consists of several backend services, and we will deploy it to AWS as an auto-scaling cluster of servers.

AWS services that will be introduced during this workshop include EC2, S3, SimpleDB, SQS, CloudFormation and IAM.
